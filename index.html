<br><b>Discrimination</b>- Refers to actions or behaviors towards an individual or a group of people. ACcording to United Nations "discriminatory behaviors take many forms, butthe all involve some form of exclusion or rejection".</br>

<br><h5><b>Genocide</b>- Action recognizing someone as different so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.</h5></br>
<h5><b>Apartheid (Separeteness, segregation or apartness)</b>- firm of racial discrimination wherein one race is viewed as less than the other</h5>

                                    <br><h5><b>Just-World Phenomenon</b>- people on both sides of the power and wealth spectrum start believing that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get.</h5></br>
                              <br><h5><b>Ingroup-Outgroup Phenomenon</b></h5></br>
                           <br><h5><b>Scapegoat theory (Frustration-Aggression Theory)</b>- prejudice as a defense mechanism on the part of the frustrated people who blame another, more disadvanteage group for the troubles they face, even those troubles stem from structural changes</br></h5></b>
                                    <br><h5><b>Culture Theory</b>- prejudice can be found in everyone because people are products of the culture they live in - and we lived in a prejudiced culture.</br></h5></b>
                               <h5><span>Stereotypes and prejudice have a pervasive and often pernicious influence on our responses to others, and also in some cases on our own behaviors. To take one example, social psychological research has found that our stereotypes may in some cases lead to stereotype threat performance decrements that are caused by the knowledge of cultural stereotypes. Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999)Spencer, S. J., Steele, C. M., & Quinn, D. M. (1999). Stereotype threat and women`s math performance. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 35, 4-28. found that when women were reminded of the (untrue) stereotype that  women are poor at math they performed more poorly on math tests than when they were not reminded of the stereotype, and other research has found stereotype threat in many other domains as well. We`ll consider the role of stereotype threat in more detail later in this chapter.
In one particularly disturbing line of research about the influence of prejudice on behaviors, Joshua Correll and his colleagues had White participants participate in an experiment in which they viewed photographs of White and Black people on a computer screen. Across the experiment, the photographs showed the people holding either a gun or something harmless such as a cell phone. The participants were asked to decide as quickly as possible to press a button to shoot if the target held a weapon but to not shoot if the person did not hold a weapon. Overall, the White participants tended to shoot more often when the person holding the object was Black than when the person holding the object was White, and this occurred even when there was no weapon present (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2007; Correll et al., 2007).Correll, J., Park, B., Judd, C. M., & Wittenbrink, B. (2007). The influence of stereotypes on decisions to shoot. European Journal of Social Psychology, 37(6), 1102-1117. doi: 10.1002/ejsp.450; Correll, J., Park, B., Judd, C. M., Wittenbrink, B., Sadler, M. S., & Keesee, T. (2007). Across the thin blue line: Police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(6), 1006-1023. doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006

Discrimination is a major societal problem because it is so pervasive, takes so many forms, and has such negative effects on so many people. Even people who are paid to be unbiased may discriminate. Price and Wolfers (2007)Price, J., & Wolfers, J. (2007). Racial discrimination among NBA referees. NBER Working Paper #13206. Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research. found that White players in National Basketball Association games received fewer fouls when more of the referees present in the game were White, and Black players received fewer fouls when more of the referees present in the game where Black. The implication is whether they know it or not the referees were discriminating on the basis of race.

I`m sure that you have had some experiences where you found yourself responding to another person on the basis of a stereotype or a prejudice, and perhaps the fact that you did surprised you. Perhaps you then tried to get past these beliefs and to react to the person more on the basis of his or her individual characteristics. We like some people and we dislike others this is natural but we should not let a person`s skin color, gender, age, religion, or ethnic background make these determinations for us. And yet, despite our best intentions, we may end up making friends only with people who are similar to us and perhaps even avoiding people whom we see as different.

In this chapter, we will study the processes by which we develop, maintain, and make use of our stereotypes and our prejudices. We will consider the negative outcomes of those beliefs on the targets of our perceptions, and we will consider ways that we might be able to change those beliefs, or at least help us stop acting upon them. Let`s begin by considering the cognitive side of our group beliefs focusing primarily on stereotypes before turning to the important role of feelings in prejudice.</h5></span>
